The aim of the map is a tour of the Plymouth historical Hoe map...
you start at the war memorial then with correct answer to the smeatons tower lighthouse.
You then go to the HMS ships on the hoe far side but if the answer is wrong you get sent back to the begining.
4th position is Drake monument and that again is based on correct answer being given or you go right back to the begining.
5th the Armada monument and to the finish.
